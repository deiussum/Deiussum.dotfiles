These are just a collection of dotfiles I use for various systems.  There's nothing too special, but I figured I would open it up in case anyone finds anything useful.

The only thing to make a special note about are the myotisx, pantherax and pteropusx directories.  These are directories where I'm storing system specific files.  I tend to use taxonomic names for my PCs and when I started using Linux more fully and was dual booting windows, I added the X suffix to indicate it was using the Linux partition.  I kind of liked that convention so I started doing that with any Linux machine I named after that.  Anyway, these files will store files in ~/.config/host-config and have things specific to them like wallpaper, or Hyprland workspace rules that only really apply on my desktop system.
